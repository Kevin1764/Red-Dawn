 soviet.1.d:0 "Five years ago we defeated the facist menace and saved our socialist motherland, now we must prepare for the battle against the capitalist world order. Our country was devastated by the war and millions of comrades died, but the communist ideals are eternal, as eternal as the soviet people, the socialist island won't be left in peace until we defeat our enemies and secure a revolution around the world. Our people must endure, the consequences of the Great Patriotic War still plague our nation, shortages of food and housing are still common, we have to rebuild fast, our enemies are preparing to strike at us. Under the liderance of comrade Stalin and our communist party, and the support of soviet people we shall triumph"
